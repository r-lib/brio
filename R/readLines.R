#' Read text lines from a file
#'
#' This is a drop in replacement for [base::readLines()] with restricted
#' functionality. Compared to [base::readLines()] it:
#' - Only works with file paths, not connections.
#' - Assumes the files are always UTF-8 encoded.
#' - Does not warn or skip embedded nulls, they will likely crash R.
#' - Does not warn if the file is missing the end of line character.
#' - The arguments `ok`, `warn`, `encoding` and `skipNul` are ignored, with a warning.
#' @param con A character string of the path to a file. Throws an error if a connection object is passed.
#' @inheritParams read_lines
#' @param ok Ignored, with a warning.
#' @param warn Ignored, with a warning.
#' @param encoding Ignored, with a warning.
#' @param skipNul Ignored, with a warning.
#' @export
#' @return A UTF-8 encoded character vector of the lines in the file.
#' @seealso [writeLines()]
