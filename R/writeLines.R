#' Write lines to a file
#'
#' This is a drop in replacement for [base::writeLines()] with restricted
#' functionality. Compared to [base::writeLines()] it:
#' - Only works with file paths, not connections.
#' - Uses [enc2utf8()] to convert `text()` to UTF-8 before writing.
#' - Uses `sep` unconditionally as the line ending, regardless of platform.
#' - The `useBytes` argument is ignored, with a warning.
#' @inheritParams write_lines
#' @inheritParams readLines
#' @param sep The end of line characters to use between lines.
#' @param useBytes Ignored, with a warning.
#' @return The UTF-8 encoded input text (invisibly).
#' @seealso [readLines()]
#' @export
#' @examples

#' close(con)
